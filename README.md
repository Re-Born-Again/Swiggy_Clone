This project is a **clone of Swiggy**, a popular food delivery platform, designed to simulate its core functionalities. The aim of this project is to replicate the user interface and basic features to provide a hands-on learning experience.

This app provides seamless user authentication with Google, displays restaurants and dishes fetched from Firestore, and includes a robust ordering and payment flow.

## Features

- Restaurant Listing: View a list of restaurants, each showing the restaurant name, rating, location and delivery time.
- Restaurant Details: Click on a restaurant to view the available dishes along with their name, prices, ratings, and descriptions.
- Add to Cart: Add dishes to your cart, with the ability to increase/decrease quantities.
